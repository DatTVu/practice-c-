Android Review
+ Application: base class, contains all other components such as activities and services. This is the first class instantiated. 
+ Each app runs in its own virtual machine
+ Can share Linux user ID to access each other's data
+ 4 components: Activities, Services, Broadcast receivers, Content Providers

Activities: Entry point for interacting with user. Single screen with user interface.
Independent of other activities

Services: entry point for keeping an app running in the background. Started services and bound
services. Started service is kept alive until its work is done. Bound service is bounded to 
another processes, so there is a dependency

Broadcast receivers: enable the system to deliver events to the app outside of regular flow.
For example: send notifications to apps that aren't currently running. Can schedule a JobService
to perform some work based on the event with JobScheduler

Content provider: manages a shared set of app data. Through content provider, other apps can
query or modify data.

Intent: an asynchronous message sent between components to activate them. Intent binds
components at run time. 
Explicit Intent: activate specific component
Implicit Intent: activate specific type of component
Activities and services, intent specifies action to perform, i.s to view or to send something
For broastcast receiver: intent define the announcement being Broadcast
Content provider is activated by content resolver

Start an intent:
1. Pass Intent to startActivity() or startActivityForResult()
2. Pass Intent to startService and bindService
3. Pass Intent to sendBroadcast() or sendOrderedBroadcast() or sendStickyBroadcast()

Android Manifest: an xml file contains info about all components of the application.
+ identifies user permissions
+ declare minium API level required
+ declare hardware and software features used or required by the app
+ declare API libraries the app needed to linked against

Activity lifecycle:
+ Activity class provides a number of callbacks allowing activity to know that a Started
has changed.
+ 6 callbacks: onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), onDestroy()
+ onCreate(): init all resource, perform start up logic that should happen only once for the
entire life of activity. Bind data to lists, associate the activity with ViewModel
